	CONNEXION
----------------------------------------
Data exchange between resource constrained devices is often realized 
using efficient hand-crafted binary encodings of the transmitted data. 
On the other hand, information exchange in distributed systems on the 
Internet is increasingly done using the widespread text-based XML
format. XML files are simple text files; using them as a means to 
exchanging data is therefore relatively inefficient in terms of data size 
and not suitable for devices with limited resources. Currently the W3C is 
finalizing the EXI standard (http://www.w3.org/XML/EXI/) which promises 
efficient encoding and compression of XML files. 

Connexion is a BSD-licensed implementation of the W3C EXI standard in the Java 
programming language. The version implemented by Connexion is currently the 
Working Draft 26.03.2008 (http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-exi-20080326/). 
Please note that this is not compatible with the latest draft/specification. 
Contributions are welcome.
